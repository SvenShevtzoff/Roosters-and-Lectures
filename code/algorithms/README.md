# Algorithms

The following algorithms are present in this folder

- genetic.py: Makes a population and by changing the worst schedules, improves the population (iterative)
- greedy.py: Makes a schedule with activities and roomslots sorted by max students (constructive)
- hillclimber.py: Starts with a single random start state and continously improves on that (iterative)
- randomise.py: Makes a random schedule not accounting for anything (constructive)
- simulatedannealing.py: Like the hillclimber only now detoriations can be accepted (iterative)
